# Tic-Tac-Toe: Like Noughts and Crosses But Better
This game application is a reproduction of a gaming classic, Tic Tac Toe. This application allows users to create a player profile to keep track of gaming history.

The objective for the player is to line up three of the same game piece in a row, while alternating turns between X's and O's. If this is achieved before the board fills up and the game ends, that player wins. Otherwise the game ends in a draw.

This application was created so that I could learn and develop skills bridging the gap between frontend and backend frameworks.

## Planning Story
This app began with some sketches. As I drew out how I thought the game would look, I incorporated different ideas and features I thought the application should be able to acheive.

Creating a list of important features further developed a layout I wanted to see.

 ## User Stories
* As a user I want to sign in/up
* As a user I want to place a game piece in an empty square
* As a user I want to be stopped from placing a game piece on an existing game piece
* As a user I want to automatically switch turns after a game pieces is played
* As a user I want to be told when there is a win or a draw
* As a user I want to see my previous gaming history
* As a user I want to be able to change my password
* As a user I want to log out

## Technologies Used
* jQuery
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript

## Unsolved Problems/Future Plans
* I would like to further develop gaming history beyond number of games played
* I would like to incorporate an auto-signin feature upon signing up
* I would like to style the game further
** Modals to separate authorization features and gaming history from the gaming board
** New status bar
** Cohesive look
